  <h2>Textentry</h2>
  Based on the <a href="textupdate.htm">textupdate widget</a>,
  this widget displays the value of a PV and allows to enter new
  values.<br>
  All configuration values are inherited from the
  <a href="textupdate.htm">textupdate widget</a>

  <H3>Detail on Behaviour</H3>
  There is a <I>update</I> and <I>edit</I> mode.
  In update mode, new values of the PV are displayed. But if
  the PV is constantly changing, it is hard to enter a new
  value because the new value will always overwrite
  what you just entered.
  Therefore the widget will switch to edit mode, i.e. "freeze"
  after the cursor is moved inside the widget.
  This means you get into edit mode as soon as you enter anything, use
  the cursor keys or click the mouse inside the textentry widget.
  Now you can edit the content undisturbed, until you either leave the
  widget by selecting another widget, in which case all entries are
  lost and replaced by the current value of the PV, or you press
  ENTER, in which case the entered value is sent to the PV.

  <h2>Stripchart</h2>
  Yet another one. Uses a SciPlot widget, modified to stop
  the flicker.<br>
  Details on properties:<br>
  "Use IOC Time" means that the time stamps from the IOC are used.
  This is an experimental option, in principle the IOC should have
  the correct time and this way you can compare values with
  their time stamps.
  In reality, if they are 1min old and you are only plotting the
  last 30secs, you see nothing, so it might not be too useful.
