  <h2>Stripchart</h2>
  A Stripchart widget, still experimental.
  Uses a SciPlot widget, modified to stop the flicker.<br>
  <H3>Details on properties:</H3>
  "Use IOC Time" means that the time stamps from the IOC are used.
  This is an experimental option, in principle the IOC should have
  the correct time and this way you can compare values with
  their time stamps.
  In reality, if they are 1min old and you are only plotting the
  last 30secs, you see nothing, so it might not be too useful.
