# Example definition file for the CALC ProcessVariable
#
# First line is magic and provides version number
# as well as EMACS mode with is not necessary
# but makes for cool coloring (by definition)
#
# Empty lines and comments beginning with '#' are ignored
#
# Syntax:
#
# <name>
# <implementation>
#
# Name is used to refer to a CALC PV ala "CALC\name"
# or "CALC\name(argA, argB, argC, ...).
#
# Implementation is in EPICS CALC record syntax,
# with A, B, C, ... being variable names for the arguments.
#
# Usage Examples:
#
# "CALC\sum(fred, jane)"
# executes the definition of "sum" with
#  A = value of fred
#  B = value of jane
# whenever either PV changes.
# The time stamp of the result is the most recent of the PVs'.
# If no time stamp is available from arguments, the current
# host time is used.
# Status/severity is maximized,
# i.e. if fred is in ??/MINOR and jane in READ/INVALID,
# the result will be READ/INVALID.

# Formula to create random number.
# This one does not need arguments.
# With no PV input, this one will never update!
# Possible circumvention: Provide a PV just to
# trigger recalculation, e.g. use
#    "CALC\random(some_1Hz_PV)"
# to see changes at ~1Hz.
