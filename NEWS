Version 1-10-0beta
------------------

Changes since 1-9-6:

  o All widgets now utilize the pv_factory facility

  o The file format is now based on a tag/value scheme; it's not
    yet XML but it is a definite improvement. Reading of old format
    files is still supported but write operations will employ the new
    format which will not be forward compatible with older versions
    of edm. You should therefore archive existing edl files before
    upgrading to the new version.

  o The embedded widget now supports scrolling and macros.

  o Edit-mode drag-and-drop has been implemented using
    a ctrl-middle-button mouse operation. Raw PV names
    (i.e. names with untranslated macro references) may
    be obtained from widgets in this manner.

  o Medm-like group visibility has been added and there are
    two associated edit-mode operations: "copy group visibility info"
    and "paste group visibility info". These may be used with
    an ungroup-edit-group sequence to copy and restore the group
    visibility information.
